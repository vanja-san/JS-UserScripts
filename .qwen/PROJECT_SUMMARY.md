# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix critical issues in the Yushima user script, specifically preventing auto-marking episodes as watched when the total number of episodes is unknown or exceeded, and fixing the output window not opening until page reload, then optimize the output window functionality for better performance.

## Key Knowledge
- The Yushima script integrates a video player on Shikimori website with automatic episode tracking
- The script has two main problems: incorrect episode marking logic and output window initialization issues
- Two versions exist: main "Yushima" and development "Yushima-Dev" for testing fixes
- Major files involved: api.js, player.js, localization.js, settings.js, yushima.user.js, and output.js
- API method `getWatchingEpisode` was modified to return both current and max episodes
- Menu commands in Tampermonkey can't be dynamically unregistered, requiring alternative approaches
- The output window would disappear after AJAX-based navigation on Shikimori
- Performance optimization techniques were applied to the output window functionality

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created Yushima-Dev directory as a copy of the original Yushima project for safe testing
- [DONE] Modified api.js to update `getWatchingEpisode` to return an object with episode and maxEpisodes
- [DONE] Updated player.js to handle the new return format and added episode validation logic
- [DONE] Added new localization messages for episode exceeding max episodes warning
- [DONE] Fixed menu command behavior to check settings at runtime instead of registration time
- [DONE] Added logic to hide output window when disabled in settings
- [DONE] Updated version string and metadata to distinguish development version
- [DONE] Created ReadMe.md for the development version
- [DONE] Fixed the disappearing output window issue by implementing reinitializeOutputWindow function
- [DONE] Updated the script to handle all navigation scenarios: history pushState, popstate events, and DOM mutations
- [DONE] Ensured that the output window state is preserved across page navigations when it should remain visible

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete implementation of both fixes in the development version
- [DONE] Test the development version to ensure both issues are resolved
- [DONE] Consider backporting fixes to main Yushima version after successful testing
- [DONE] Document any additional improvements or discovered issues during testing
- [DONE] Optimize output window functionality for better performance and user experience
