# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix two critical issues in the Yushima user script: 1) Prevent auto-marking episodes as watched when the total number of episodes is unknown or exceeded, and 2) Fix the output window not opening until page reload.

## Key Knowledge
- The Yushima script integrates a video player on Shikimori website with automatic episode tracking
- The script has two main problems: incorrect episode marking logic and output window initialization
- Two versions exist: main "Yushima" and development "Yushima-Dev" for testing fixes
- Major files involved: api.js, player.js, localization.js, settings.js, yushima.user.js
- API method `getWatchingEpisode` needed modification to return both current and max episodes
- Menu commands in Tampermonkey can't be dynamically unregistered, requiring alternative approaches

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created Yushima-Dev directory as a copy of the original Yushima project for safe testing
- [DONE] Modified api.js to update `getWatchingEpisode` to return an object with episode and maxEpisodes
- [DONE] Updated player.js to handle the new return format and added episode validation logic
- [DONE] Added new localization messages for episode exceeding max episodes warning
- [DONE] Fixed menu command behavior to check settings at runtime instead of registration time
- [DONE] Added logic to hide output window when disabled in settings
- [DONE] Updated version string and metadata to distinguish development version
- [DONE] Created ReadMe.md for the development version

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete implementation of both fixes in the development version
- [TODO] Test the development version to ensure both issues are resolved
- [TODO] Consider backporting fixes to main Yushima version after successful testing
- [TODO] Document any additional improvements or discovered issues during testing
